# Smart Water Level Monitoring System

## Overview
The Smart Water Level Monitoring System is a microcontroller-based solution designed to continuously monitor water levels in storage tanks and automate control operations to improve water management efficiency.

## Objectives
- Monitor water level in real time
- Prevent water overflow and dry-run conditions
- Reduce manual monitoring
- Improve efficient water usage

## System Description
The system uses water level sensors placed at different heights of the tank. A microcontroller processes sensor inputs and controls output devices such as indicators or pumps based on water level conditions.

## Hardware Components
- Microcontroller (Arduino / equivalent)
- Water Level Sensors
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Power Supply

## Software Tools
- Arduino IDE
- Embedded C / Arduino Programming

## Working Principle
1. Sensors detect the water level inside the tank.
2. Sensor signals are sent to the microcontroller.
3. Based on predefined logic, the system controls the pump.
4. Alerts or indicators show current water level status.

## Applications
- Domestic water tanks
- Industrial water storage systems
- Overhead tank automation
- Smart water management systems

## Results
- Improved water management
- Reduced water wastage
- Reliable and automated operation

## Future Enhancements
- IoT-based remote monitoring
- Mobile app integration
- SMS or cloud alerts
